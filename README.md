## Rogue A.I. - An Unofficial Star Realms Expansion for Android

This app adds a new mode to the deck building game Star Realms by White Wizard Games (http://www.whitewizardgames.com/) featuring 
an enemy player controlled by the app.

It features:

* A simple life-counter to keep track of both team's scores.
* Random events every time the Rogue A.I. is damaged.
* Easily select starting health to adjust difficulty (Coming Soon!).

## Setup (draft)

* Give Rogue A.I. the Brainworld card. This is its starting card.
* All other setup is the same as the standard game

## Rules of Play (draft)

* Any red card revealed either during setup or during play is placed in front of the Brainworld and is now a part of the 
Rogue A.I.'s military strength.
* All human players share their health
* Rogue A.I.'s defense is equal to the Brainworld's defense.
* Rogue A.I.'s attack is equal to the combined attack of all cards in its possession.
* Whenever a player damages the Rogue A.I., that player must click the center message screen and unveil a random event.
* Rogue A.I. can only lose cards by the random events displayed.
